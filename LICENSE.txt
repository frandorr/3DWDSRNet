Preamble
Most software today is developed with little to no thought of how it will be used, or the consequences for our society and planet.
As software developers, we engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognise that our infrastructure has great power to shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we choose to consciously take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.
We envisage a world free from injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our planet. We reject slavery in all its forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world where humankind is at peace with our neighbours, nature, and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all society.
We build software to further this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that vision further from reach.
